    <h3> About me </h3>
    <p>Hi! My name is Ashley, I'm a rising Junior studying CS at Harvard. I went to high school in Sydney, but I now spend most of my time either in Boston (where school is) or Melbourne (where my family now is).  </p>

    <h5> My opinions on the weather </h5>
    <p> After moving to Boston, I was introduced to the concept of horizontal rain. This phenomenon occurs when there is fine rain and strong winds. Umbrellas and coats are futile, there is no protection against horizontal rain.</p>
    <p> Melbourne is both unpredictable and cold! </p>

    <h5> My hobbies </h5>
    <p> I enjoy dancing, watching my brother bake (and claiming the results for myself) as well as taking long walks with my dog.</p>
